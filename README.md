# Sample Spring Cloud Config for the JHipster Registry

This is a sample repository used by the [JHipster Registry](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry).

When running the JHipster Registry with the `git` profile, it uses this sample repository by default, and will serve the `application.yml` file that is located at the root directory.

For real-world usage, you should replace this repository by your own repository, where you can manage your own Yaml configuration files.
